# Insight_Coding_Challange
The source code for this challange can be found in src folder as pharmacy_counting.py. This code reads the input file line by line. Two dictionaries - drug_cost (to get total drug cost) and doctor_names (to check unique doctor name for each drug)were created. The dictionary drug_cost is sorted and output is in csv file.
